-  KaaribogaClassLoader and some agents:
   - minor code changes, because Kaariboga was no longer
     compatible to the current Java version 1.5.
- added the scripts "compile" and "startdomainserver"
- Boga:
  - uses Log to write status messages
  - additional parameters for logging in boga.config
- DomainServer: writes additional debug information
- DomainPlugIn: uses Log to write status messages
- changed "domainPlugIn.config" so that it works on Ubuntu
  dapper drake by default. (domainServer=127.0.1.1)
- Log: added method getLoglevel

2003-02-09
- KaaribogaClassLoader:
  - serveral bug fixes
  - class loader now uses DeliveryService for communication
- Test of new IO architecture

2002-11-03
- KaaribogaBase: new method loadKaariboga
- Boga: loading of agents now works by calling 
        KaaribogaBase.loadKaariboga

2002-10-16
- KaaribogaInputStream
  Replaced parameter KaaribogaAddress with KaaribogaBase
- KaaribogaClassLoader

2002-09-27
- removed inner classes SendMessageThread and
  ReceiveMessageThread from KaaribogaBase.
  Message are delivered now using DeliveryService

2002-09-02
- Added field id to KaaribogaMessage
- Changed KbMessageHandler to handle delivery errors
  including a message id.


2002-09-01
- package org.kaariboga.boserver deleted and replaced with
  org.kaariboga.domainserver.



2002-08-28
  Developer version
- new package org.kaariboga.io.
  This is a first step towards a restructuring of 
  input/output operations. The package inludes a new class
  called DeliverySerice, which should be used for network
  traffic in the future. This makes it easy to add new
  kinds of protocols.  
- new package org.kaariboga.domainserver
  The new domain server replaces the old boserver.
  Start with java org.kaariboga.domainserver.Main
- new package org.kaariboga.util including a
  static Log class and a simple timer.
  The Log class makes it possible to write logging messages
  to a file and use different logging levels.


2002-06-16
- Bug fixe in Boga server:
  Plug-Ins were loaded to early and did not get the 
  right port number.
- some bug fixes in plug-in stuff
- Agents, that used a domain, now use the domain plug-in.
- Minor changes to the domain server. Several KaaribogaBases
  on one host are allowed now.
  This makes it possible to run a full testing environment
  with several bases on a single computer.


2001-08-26
- Moved agents directory back to org/kaariboga/agents
  instead of building a new subtree. This makes
  developement a bit easier. However it is not a
  good idea in the sense of security.
- bug fixes and enhancements to the plug-in concept
- new plug-in domainPlugIn, but not working yet


2001-07-30
- new Interface: KbMessageHandler
- minor changes to the plug-in stuff
- Additions to KaaribogaBase to handle plug-ins
- changes on Boga to handle plug-ins
- new example agent: HelloPlugInAgent


2001-07-23
- renamed PlugIn* to KbPlugIn*.
- continues coding of KbPlugInManager and KbPlugIn.
- coded simple plug-in example HelloPlugIn.


2001-07-17
- Bug Fix: Boga.java: Agents could not be loaded using FileChooser on
           Windows systems.
- Started some coding for plug-ins.


2001-07-09
- Includes Mark's latest bug fixes to handle messages for local base.
  
  
2001-06-03
- Includes Mark's latest bug fixes:
  - clean shutdown of server socket in KaaribogaBase
  - proper handling of connecting streams to sockets.
- Bug fixes on network code in BoServer.
- minor changes in many places


2001-03-25
- polishing of the dynamic IP code
- minor changes in many places


2001-03-17
- BoServer is now able to determine the IP address of
  an asking host.
- BogaServer can use dynamic IP addresses now.
  When an IP address server is specified is the boga.config 
  file it sends a GET_MY_IP_ADDRESS message to the IP address
  server and receives a YOUR_IP_ADDRESS message in return. 


2001-02-06
- minor changes on class loader, class manager, and
  kaariboga input stream from Mark.


2001-01-07
- This is an enhancement to Mark's previous work concerning
  the loading of agents from different directory structures.
- The agents are now in a subdirectory structure inside the
  agents directory. The subdirectory structure resembles the
  usual Java package hierachy. Name space are now obsolete.
  - Boga 
  - It should be possible to load agents with a 
    File Chooser dialog. 
  - To load an agent it must be referenced with it's full
    package name.
  - ClassManager
  - Constructor has a String array to handle multiple
    paths for agent classes.


2000-12-03
- Boga
  - Exit Menu Item added
  - Server Menu for going on- and offline added
  - changed menu handling for better readability
  - menu items are now disabled if they can't be used
- KaaribogaBase
  - startBase and stopBase renamed as goOnline and goOffline
  - new method getOnlineStatus


2000-11-12
- BoMain, 
  BoModel: Changed exception messages to the format
           we agreed on.
- BoModel:
  - More messages (see class documentation): 
    GET_BASES 
    GET_MY_IP_ADDRESS
    YOUR_IP_ADDRESS 
    The mechanism of determing an IP address this way
    is not testet yet.
  - addresses of all connected servers are no longer
    broadcasted, when a BASE_ONLINE or BASE_OFFLINE
    message arrives. This saves bandwith. Instead
    servers may determine all connected servers by
    sending a GET_BASES message.


2000-10-17
- ClassLoader
  Mark's changes to the classmanager to allow
  agents not in package kaariboga.agents
